Identity Operator(is , is not)
-----------------
->In python, every object is having Identity number .
->An Identity number is an unique number.
->An Identity number of an object is used to recognise it fast in the memory.
-> To know the identity no.of an object we have to use id function.[id()]


>>> id(a)// a is variable name 100 is data
140724363361632//id number

-> Identity Operator are used to check whether identity numbers of the objects are same or not.if they are same true is return,
   ortherwise false is return.

>>> i=j=200
>>> id(i)
140724363364832
>>> id(j)
140724363364832

-> if data is same ids identity number will be same
