IDLE->Integrated Devlopment Environment
->IDLE is used to write python programing  and execute python programing.
->Throug IDLE python programs can be executed in two ways.
         1.Intractive Mode of Execution
         2.Batch mode of execution


  Intractive mode of execution
------------------------------------------

-> python programing line can be execute it imediatly.
(Line by Line execution)
->intractive mode is used for testing line-by-line of program.

  ex:>>> 100+2000     >>> 200-100
      2100                100
     
>>> print("hey i anil")
hey i anil

    Batch mode of execution
-----------------------------------------------

->We typed all the lines of programming in a file
->Save the file
->Execute the file, So that all line of programing are executed at a time.

STEPS
------
1.Open IDLE
2.select new file option from file menu.

a=100
b=200
print("Additon of two numbers=",a+b)
print("Subtraction of two numbers=",a-b)
print("Multiplication of two numbers=",a*b)
print("Divison of two numbers=",a/b)

save the file in python37
->filename.py
go to run and select run module or F5

      output
-----------------------
Additon of two numbers= 300
Subtraction of two numbers= -100
Multiplication of two numbers= 20000
Divison of two numbers= 0.5
