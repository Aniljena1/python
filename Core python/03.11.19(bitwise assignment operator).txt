----------------------------
bitwise assignment operator performs two operations.
1.bitwise operator
2.assignment operator
the following or the bitwise assignment operator |= ^=  >>=  <<= 
>>>a=10
>>>b=20
>>>a &= b   //a=a&b => 10&20 =0
>>>a
0

2.
>>>a=10
>>>b=20
>>>a |= b   //a=a|b => 10|20 =0
>>>a
