Static Variables
-----------------
if the Data is not changing from object to object.
or if the data is static to all objects than we stored that static data in static variables.
if a variable is prefixed with a class name then it called static variable.

digram:"staic variable diagram"

here companey_id,name,adress is static variables.

->satic variables are pre fixed with class name

Ex:employee.company_id
       |          |
   classname    static variable

static variables are created when class is loadded into memory.
Ex: When employee class is loaded then immediately static variables are created, There are companey_nmae,companey_address etc.

                  Instance Variable                                                 Staic Variable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.When data is changing from one instance to           | 1.When data is not changing from one object to another object we 
  another instace we are use instance variable.        |    are use instance variable.
                                                       |
2.Instance Variable are fixed with "self".             | 2.Staic Variable are pre fixed with class name.
                                                       |
Ex: self.employee_id                                   | ex:employee.company_id
                                                       |
3.Instance Variable are created when object is created | 3.static Variable  are created when class is created.
                                                       |
4.Number of objects= Number of copies of instance      | 4.Number of objects= Single  copies of static variables
  variable.                                            |  i.e Number of objectes share a single copy of static variables.
                                                       | -> Static varibels are stored in a single copy, So the memory will be saved.
5. Instance Variable are declared in:                  | 5. Static Variable are declared in:
   1.Instance method                                   |      1.Outside of all Method in a class
   2.Constructors                                      |      2.within the Constructor
   3.Outside of the class                              |      3.within Instance Method
                                                       |      4.within static Method
                                                       |      5.within Class Method
                                                       |      6.Outside of the class
