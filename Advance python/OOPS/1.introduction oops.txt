 Abstraction                                                                                     Example
---------------                                                                              ----------------
-> Presenting essential information and hidding unessential information.               case1                    case2
                                                                                      DOCTOR                     BANK

-> Gathering require data leaving unnessary data

Ex: let us apply abstaraction princepal on employee of the companey

Essential details of the Employee of the Companey                                          Hideing

1. EMP Name - 'anil'                                                                     Familey details
2.  EMP Id - '101'                                                                       Finaceal Details
3. EMP desig - 'Maneger'                                                                 Properties Details
4. EMP jd - '23-3-95'
5. EMP add - 'bbsr'

->On the Data we perform the Operation .
->To perform operation we need methods.
->Method we used perform the operation on data.
->Class is collection variables and Methods.

Encapsulations
-----------------
        
  Combineing or Binding variables and methods into a class is called as encapsulation.

 Class
--------
->Class is a collection of variables and Methods.

Q:what is a Variable?
Ans: Variable stores the Data.
Ex: employeeIDs='E101'
      |            |
   (variable)    (value)

Q: What is a Object?
Ans:Method on perform operation on data.
